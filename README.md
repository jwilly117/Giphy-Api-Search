# Giphy API Search

### Summary
This is a site which utilized the giphy api to call a list of gifs with a given keyword for the search. 

### The goal of this project
The objective here is to make a page where basically a user makes a list of breakfast foods, some of which is already populated for demonstration. Then, that list can be used to pull images from the giphy api, 10 at a time. 

### File Structure
This is one simple page with one CSS file and one JS file, the page is relatively simple and most of the code is inside the JS file to retrieve the gifs, and change their state once a user hovers over them with the mouse. (Gifs are moving pictures).

### Instructions
Upon loading the page, input whatever food (or anything else) into the text box and submit the input. The item will be added to the list. 
Then, the user can click on the button that the list has created, which will then pull 10 images from Giphy with that item as the keyword. 
Please note: The site is themed for breakfast food, but any word will work.
